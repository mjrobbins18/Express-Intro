## SEIR 712 August 27th, 2021

Lets get the hard part out of the way. Before we begin, lets enter 

```

npm install --global nodemon

```

into our terminal and install this nifty addon called Nodemon. Nodemon will allow our servers to refresh automatically so that we do not have to refresh the full express server ourselves every time we want to make a change.


# Intro to Express

Today is a big day in SEI! We've built front-end applications using our knowledge and expertise of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Over the next few weeks we're going to venture in to new territory: building full-stack applications by working with and building up Back End Databases!

Some of the new terminology we'll be using today is "Client Side" (Front end, everything the user sees and does) and Server Side (Back End, everything going on behind the scenes)

The framework we'll be using in this unit is called ExpressJS (Express). Express runs on NodeJS and provides us with some help in building out fullstack applications and APIs.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, developers should be able to:

- Explain and understand the request-response cycle
- Discuss how the Web works including:
  - Browser requests
  - Status codes
  - HTTP methods and REST
- Build a simple server-side application with Express

## Introduction

Express is a framework for building web applications. In software development, frameworks include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system. There are lots of different kinds of frameworks for different kinds of tasks.  Express helps us build applications on NodeJS for the World Wide Web (Web).

## How does the Web Work

Before we can build our first full-stack application, we need to discuss how the Web works. Once we know a little bit about how the Web works, we can start to think about how Express (our back-end) fits in with our front-end.

### Client-Server

The Web follows a model of communication called `client-server`. In the context of the Web, our browsers serve as the `client`. The other side of the equation is the `server` - a computer or application somewhere that responds to the requests from our browser.

![Client-Server](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/17300/files/8d5a2c80-4670-11ea-8a29-610723d36c34)

The client and server communicate using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the `request-response` cycle.

### HTTP

HTTP is a **protocol** which establishes the rules for communication over the Web. HTTP dictates how the client requests information from a server and how the server responds. Each message is similarly formatted - so you can think of them as like electronic telegrams.

Requests always have these three parts:

1. Request line (including the URL and the HTTP Method)
1. Request header (additional information about the request and what we expect in the response)
1. Body message (optional - things like form data)

Responses in turn always have these three parts:

1. Status (a status code indicating how the request was handled)
1. Response header (additional information about the response)
1. Body message (optional - an html document, JSON, XML)

Clients make requests to a location (called a URL) using a method.

<img width="1569" alt="url" src="https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/17300/files/63086f00-4670-11ea-94be-9ba3acdb30f1">

There are 10 possible HTTP methods, but the 5 that we'll be focused on are:

| Method Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GET | Used for retrieving data from a server. |
| POST | Used for sending data to the server. |
| PUT | Used for replacing data on the server. |
| PATCH | Used for updating data on the server. |
| DELETE | Used for deleting data from the server. |

When the server receives a request, it processes the message and then sends a response. The server always sends a response, though sometimes that response is just to tell the client that there was an error.

The status codes are also defined by the protocol:

| Status Code | Description | Example
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1xx | Informational | 101 Continue |
| 2xx | OK | 201 Created |
| 3xx | Redirection | 301 Moved Permanently |
| 4xx | Client Errors | 404 Not Found |
| 5xx | Server Errors | 500 Internal Server Error |

#### How does it actually work

When you type a URL in the navigation bar of your browser, you make a GET request to that URL (i.e. `http://www.google.com`). The server receives that message and formulates a response: a 200 status code (to indicate everything worked out just fine) and an HTML document for the Google home page.

When you click on a link, you're making a GET request to a URL, just like when you type the URL in the navigation bar of your browser. The server receives the request and sends a response with a new HTML document for you.

When you submit a form, you make a POST request.  Data from the form is sent as part of the request body. The server processes the request (perhaps saving the request body to a database) and then sends a response.

### Modern Web Applications

When the Web was first created, you would request a document that already existed on the server. So when you typed in `http://www.timberners-lee.com`, you received an HTML document on Tim's server. If you wanted to see the about page on Tim's website, you would navigate to `http://www.timberners-lee.com/about.html`. The important thing to note is that someone wrote those HTML pages in full and by hand.

That worked well when the Web was just used for sharing scientific documents, but imagine how different the web would be if you had to create and maintain a separate HTML document for every page in your web app! What a load of work! We don't have time for that! We're programmers!

> True story: this is why PHP was created.

Instead of writing all that HTML by hand, we send data to the client or dynamically generate an HTML document from a template and send that document using Express and other web frameworks!

## Express

Express is a minimalistic web framework. Compared to web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails, Express is tiny. It was intentionally designed that way. It's both minimal and unopinionated.  This minimalism comes with some trade-offs. On the one hand, you it's extremely flexible and doesn't unnecessarily bloat your code with things that you don't need. It also means you'll be responsible for building out everything you do need.

At it's core, Express is meant to be a very light abstraction over the native Node HTTP modules as a way of giving developers a few convenient features:

Like React, Express is written in a form of Javascript, so hopefully a lot of the vocabulary will be familiar. 
Here are some new(ish) terms we'll be working with 

- Routing
- Views
- Middleware
- Modularity with subapplications

These are the core features of Express.

## Setting up an Express App

1. Create a new directory called "express-hello-world" in your sandbox.
1. Change into the new directory
1. Run `npm init -y`.
1. Type `npm install express` or the shorthand version of `npm i express`.
1. Work through the rest of this lesson

### Getting Started

Building our first server is pretty straightforward. Create an `index.js` file and write the following inside of it:

```js
const express = require("express")
const app = express()

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("app listening on port 4000")
})
```

To start up our server, we just need to execute this file with node:

```sh
node index.js
```

What's going on here?

- we're requiring the Express module, which is a function that returns an instance of a web app
- we're invoking the module, instantiating a constant app which holds all the methods and state we use to write and run our web app
- we're starting our server (and app) by listening on port 4000 for incoming requests

When we run the application from the terminal, `node index.js`, we can see app listening on port 4000 printed to the terminal. The process continues to run, occupying the shell until we hit ctrl + c.

If we visit `http://localhost:4000` in the browser, we'll see something like this:

```sh
Cannot GET /
```

Our app is running and we're able to visit it in the browser. But we're missing routes!

### Routing

The first key feature that Express provides is simple and easy routing.

A *route* is a URI (path) and an HTTP method. The path is part of the URL, so if we visit `http://www.cat-astrophy.com/whiskers` the URI will be `/whiskers`. The HTTP method will be the method we want to accept: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.

Express contains a function for each HTTP method which in turn accepts a path as the first argument then some number of callback functions. We'll start with just one callback function.

Let's update `index.js`. Add this above `app.listen()`

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('Hello World')
})
```

Let's break down the syntax here.

```js
  app.get()
```

`app` is the variable we've declared above. It's an `instance` of the express server. `get()` is a function that tells express what `http method` to listen for.

```js
  app.get('/')
```

The first argument that `get()` takes is the `path`. This one is set to the root of wherever our server is listening (which is `http://localhost:4000`).

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {})
```

The second argument that `get()` takes is a function. It's how we tell express what we want to do when the server receives a GET request at the root `'/'` url. The preferred syntax is to use arrow functions here, to keep it concise.

In the example above, the callback function is given two arguments: the first represents the HTTP request object and the second represents the HTTP response object.

**We always have to send a response**. We do that by using the response variable that we've declared in the callback. So we end up with a working route!

```js
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.send('Hello World')
})
```

We've added a route and a handler for requests to the `'/'` route. In this case, we're sending the string `'Hello World'` as the response. Let's see if this takes effect in the browser:

```
Cannot GET /
```

No change. The running server won't change until we restart it and refresh the page. Once we do that, we'll see:

```
Hello World
```

Constantly needing to restart the server will get very tedious, very quickly. Instead, we can use the `nodemon` module to run our server. Instead of requiring `nodemon` in our code, we use `nodemon` from the command line. Then, `nodemon` will restart our server for us whenever a file is changed.

Install the nodemon package with `npm i nodemon --save`, or with the shorthand `npm i nodemon --D`.  The `--save` or `-D` will install nodemon as a **devDependency** in our `package.json`. That means it will only be used during development, not during production deployments. 

> You can install nodemon globally if you do not have it with `npm install --global nodemon`
>
> When using the `--global` flag (or `-g` for short), we're specifying that `nodemon` will be installed "globally" so we can utilize `nodemon` across all of our node applications (and also that it is not included in our project dependencies).

We start up our application a bit differently now:

```sh
nodemon index.js
```

#### Params in Express

How do we make our routes dynamic? Using parameters!

Route parameters give us flexibility when writing routes in Express.

Let's update `index.js` to include:

```js
app.get('/:food', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`I like ${req.params.food}`)
})
```

> Note: the `request` and `response` objects are often shortened to just `req` and `res`.

Our route has changed! What is different?

Route parameters are named segments of our URI, they are placeholders (like variables) that capture values at their location in a URL. These values are held in the `req.params` object and can be used to deliver custom responses to an HTTP request.  

Now if we visit `http://localhost:4000/Pizza`, we should see:

```
I like Pizza
```

What do you think we'll see if we visit `http://localhost:4000/bacon-cheeseburger`?

How about `http://localhost:4000/chocolate%20cake`?

Where else have we seen these kinds of dynamic segments in routes?

### Views

Right now our simple Express application is just sending back a string of content, instead of an entire HTML file. As we're building complex applications we need to be able to dynamically create entire HTML pages, something Express makes simple with **views**.

We're going to use Handlebars for creating our views. Handlebars, a templating language, allows us to write HTML with inline variables that we can fill in with data from our application. That means, we can have the following handlebars template:

```hbs
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
```

And in our Express app, pass in an object that sets the `name` property. Whatever value is in our `name` property will be output in our HTML!

```js
app.get('/:name', function(req, res) {
  res.render('templateName', { name: req.params.name })
})
```

If we visit `http://localhost:4000/Ishmael`, then the HTML we would get back would be:

```html
<h1>Call me Ishmael</h1>
```

Let's set up our Express app to use Handlebars. We first need to install it as a project dependency:

```bash
$ npm install hbs
```

In `index.js`, let's [configure our express app](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) to use Handlebars as its "view engine". Put this below the requires, but above the routes.

```js
app.set('view engine', 'hbs')
```

Let's go ahead and create a directory that will contain our templates in the root directory of the Hello World application. In the terminal:

```bash
$ mkdir views
$ touch views/index.hbs
$ touch views/layout.hbs
```

Let's change up our existing `index.js` to utilize a template rather than sending in a string directly. In `index.js`:

```js
app.get('/:name', function(req, res) {
  res.render('index', { name: req.params.name })
})
```

Instead of directly building a string as the response to that `GET` request, we want to render a view using Handlebars.

The `.render` method takes two arguments:

  1. The name of the view we want to render
  2. An object with values that will be made available in the view

The only problem is our view is empty! Let's go ahead and change that now. In `views/layouts.hbs`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Express Intro</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   {{{body}}}
  </body>
</html>
```

Like App, Main, and Index.js files in React, these files can be used as a nexus to link to other files, or as containers to hold JS functionality as well as content. And like Main, Nav, Header... these hbs files will make more sense in their use and limitations as we continue to work with them. 

Notice the `{{{body}}}` syntax. This is because Handlebars here escapes HTML by default, and so we need the additional set of brackets to indicate that you want to render the tags in the body as HTML. This is pretty much Not going to change, so set it and forget it (like installing the react router dom)

Having this set up now allows us to utilize files in that folder in the layout.

Finally we should update our index view to reflect the same strings we had before. In `views/index.hbs`:

```html
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
```

Start your server back up using `nodemon index.js`, and refresh your page to see it render.

It should look the same. Now try to add some thing else between the 2 Index files -  .hbs and .js - and see what you can do. This is just a basic H1 tag, but as you can imagine, we can have all kinds of cool HTML content in here, and can use it to manipulate the regular DOM similar to how we did with React.

## You Do: 99 Bottles of Beer

In the time remaining, work through building out an app for the song 99 Bottles of Beer.

The instructions for this exercise can be found [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-712/99_bottles_express).

## Introducing Middleware

The third major feature that Express provides is Middleware.

Middleware is just a function that transforms the `request` and/or the `response` object. Middleware functions get called in a series and each updates or transforms the `request` and/or the `response` object before passing them on to the next function in the series. 

![Diagram showing how middleware runs between the request and response.](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/17300/files/332c3480-2011-11eb-8a70-d0062f78183e)

Middleware is what makes it so we can build complex applications with Express - we'll use middleware for a lot of things, including:

- working with form data
- authentication
- logging
- error handling

Let's make it so our Hello World app takes someone's name through a form that a user submits, instead of through a route parameter.

We need a new route and a new view with a form. In `index.js`:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render("welcome")
})
```

Now, we'll create a welcome file at the command line:
`touch views/welcome.hbs`

```html
<!-- views/welcome.hbs -->
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<form action="/" method="post">
  <label for="name">Please enter your name</label>
  <input id="name" type="text" name="name">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

Refresh your browser, and submit a name in the form:

```
Cannot POST /
```

Express doesn't have a way to handle this request! We only set up a route for `GET` requests:

```js
// index.js
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello there!')
})
```

Well this works, but it's not super valuable, and we are not capturing the user input.

How can we greet the name submitted in the form?

That's where middleware comes in...

By default, Express does not handle information posted from a form. In order to get form or JSON data in a `POST` request, we need to tell it to use some middleware – code that runs in between receiving the request and sending the response.

```js
// add `express.json` middleware which will parse JSON requests into
// JS objects before they reach the route files.
// The method `.use` sets up middleware for the Express application
app.use(express.json())
// this parses requests that may use a different content type
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
```

Another thing to note is that, in Express, `req.params` holds just path params. Anything handled by the parser will be held in `req.body`.

So we change the final post request in `index.js` to:

```js
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`hello ${req.body.name}`)
})
```

> Where did the `name` variable come from? Why is it called that?

<details>
  <summary>
  Answer
  </summary>

  In our HTML, the input field has a `name` attribute. So anything we set that equal to becomes the variable name in `req.body`

  If we change it to "firstname" we can then grab `req.body.firstName`

  The value will be equal to whatever was typed in the input field.

  ```html
  <input id="name" type="text" name="firstName">
  ```
</details>

Once we've confirmed that is working, we'll integrate the name into our index template:

```js
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {
    name: req.body.firstName,
  })
})
```

And to our view in `index.hbs`:

```html
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
```

## Closing

Our first step is to get a basic understanding of Express, how it works and what it does for us. Over the next few lessons, we'll learn how to build larger applications using Express.
